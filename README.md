# CPSC 349 project

## Regional Cloud
This is Group 6 for CPSC 349-06, and we are working on a timezone project to show users the times in places worldwide. Our features included displaying a location's weather and converting the timezone of that location simultaneously. We also have another page that allows you to convert a timezone to another.
We are working on polishing the pages and the map.
