CPSC 349 project
We are working on a timezone project to show users the times in places worldwide. I would like to add a feature to convert a time to a user's desired timezone, as it is a tool I use to find out when an announcement or update is happening.

The API i plan to use is timezonedb and the documention is here https://timezonedb.com/api
